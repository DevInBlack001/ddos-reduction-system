//! Running mean and variance over a stream of samples.
//!
//! Accumulating a sum and a sum of squares and subtracting them loses all
//! precision on a long stream: the two terms nearly cancel. This works with
//! small deltas against the running mean instead.
//!
//!     delta  = x - old_mean
//!     mean  += delta / n
//!     delta2 = x - new_mean
//!     M2    += delta * delta2
//!
//! Multiplying the two deltas carries the sum of squares from the old mean to
//! the new one in one step, with no stored history.
//!
//! `n` is capped so the mean stays responsive. Without a cap `delta / n`
//! approaches zero and the baseline freezes. Once capped, M2 decays too, which
//! makes this a bounded memory approximation rather than exact variance.
//!
//! Golden vector: `[4, 7, 13, 16]` gives mean 10.0 and variance 30.0.
